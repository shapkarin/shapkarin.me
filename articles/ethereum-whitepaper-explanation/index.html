Bitcoin handles simple transactions, but Ethereum can run any program through smart contracts and supports complex applications like DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.","category":"comparison"},{"question":"What are smart contracts?","answer":"Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms written in code. They work like vending machines - you input what's required, and if conditions are met, you automatically get what was promised without needing intermediaries.","category":"technology"},{"question":"What is Ethereum gas?","answer":"Gas is payment for computational work on Ethereum. It's like paying for gasoline to drive your car - more complex operations cost more gas. This prevents spam and ensures network security.","category":"technology"},{"question":"Is Ethereum better than Bitcoin?","answer":"They serve different purposes. Bitcoin is digital gold (store of value), while Ethereum is a platform for building applications. Both have value in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.","category":"comparison"},{"question":"How much does it cost to use Ethereum?","answer":"Costs vary based on network congestion. Gas fees can range from $1 to $100+ during peak times. Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum offer much lower costs.","category":"practical"},{"question":"What can you build on Ethereum?","answer":"You can build decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), games, social networks, and any application that benefits from decentralization.","category":"applications"},{"question":"Is Ethereum secure?","answer":"The Ethereum network itself is very secure, protected by thousands of validators. However, individual smart contracts can have bugs, so always use audited and well-tested applications.","category":"security"},{"question":"Who created Ethereum?","answer":"Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin, who wrote the original whitepaper in 2014 when he was just 19 years old. The platform launched in 2015 with help from other co-founders.","category":"history"},{"question":"What programming languages work with Ethereum?","answer":"Solidity is the most popular language for smart contracts, but you can also use Vyper.

Buterin in 2014 that introduced the world to Ethereum - a revolutionary blockchain platform that goes far beyond digital currency.</p><h3 id="quick-facts">Quick Facts:</h3><ul><li><strong>Published</strong>: 2014 by Vitalik Buterin</li><li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Introduce a "world computer" concept</li><li><strong>Key Innovation</strong>: Smart contracts on blockchain</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: Enabled decentralized applications (dApps)</li></ul><p><strong>Simple Definition</strong>: Think of the Ethereum Whitepaper as the blueprint for building a global, decentralized computer that anyone can use to create applications without needing permission from any central authority.</p><hr><h2 id="understanding-bitcoin-first-the-foundation">Understanding Bitcoin First: The Foundation</h2><p>Before diving into Ethereum, the whitepaper explains Bitcoin as the starting point:</p><h3 id="what-bitcoin-solved">What Bitcoin Solved:</h3><ol><li><strong>Digital Money Without Banks</strong>: Created the first working digital currency that doesn't need banks</li><li><strong>Double-Spending Problem</strong>: Prevented people from spending the same digital coin twice</li><li><strong>Decentralized Consensus</strong>: Allowed a network to agree on transactions without a central authority</li></ol><h3 id="bitcoin-s-limitations">Bitcoin's Limitations:</h3><ul><li><strong>Limited Programming</strong>: Can only handle simple transactions</li><li><strong>Single Purpose</strong>: Designed specifically for money transfers</li><li><strong>No Complex Logic</strong>: Cannot execute complicated rules or conditions</li></ul><p><strong>Analogy</strong>: If Bitcoin is like a calculator that can only add and subtract money, Ethereum is like a full computer that can run any program.</p><hr><h2

Ethereum better than Bitcoin?</h3><p><strong>A</strong>: They serve different purposes. Bitcoin is digital gold (store of value), while Ethereum is a platform for building applications. Both have value in the ecosystem.</p><h3 id="q-how-much-does-it-cost-to-use-ethereum">Q: How much does it cost to use Ethereum?</h3><p><strong>A</strong>: Costs vary based on network congestion. Gas fees can range from $1 to $100+ during peak times. Layer 2 solutions offer much lower costs.</p><h3 id="q-is-ethereum-secure">Q: Is Ethereum secure?</h3><p><strong>A</strong>: The Ethereum network itself is very secure, but individual smart contracts can have bugs. Always use audited and well-tested applications.</p><h3 id="q-can-anyone-build-on-ethereum">Q: Can anyone build on Ethereum?</h3><p><strong>A</strong>: Yes!
