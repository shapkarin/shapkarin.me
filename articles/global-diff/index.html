it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"diff-browser-globals is a debugging tool that identifies which global variables have been added to your browser's window object beyond the standard set. It's useful for detecting global scope pollution from third-party scripts, debugging naming conflicts, and ensuring your code doesn't accidentally create unwanted global variables."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does diff-browser-globals detect new global variables?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The tool works by comparing the current window object properties with a known baseline of standard browser globals. It identifies any properties that exist in the current window but not in the baseline, revealing variables that have been added during runtime by your application or third-party scripts."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can diff-browser-globals help debug third-party script issues?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, it's particularly useful for identifying what global variables third-party scripts (like analytics, advertising, or widget scripts) are adding to your page. This helps you understand potential naming conflicts and track down unexpected behavior caused by global scope pollution."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is diff-browser-globals compatible with all browsers?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The tool is designed to work with modern browsers that support standard JavaScript features. Since different browsers may have slightly different baseline globals, the tool accounts for these variations when detecting new additions to the global scope."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I contribute to the diff-browser-globals project?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The project welcomes contributions through its GitHub repository. You can contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting new features, improving documentation, adding support for additional browsers, or enhancing the detection algorithms. Pull requests and issues are actively reviewed and appreciated."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use diff-browser-globals in my automated testing?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, the tool can be integrated into automated testing workflows to ensure that your application doesn't introduce unexpected global variables.

yourself wondering, “What exactly is getting added to the global <code>window</code> object in my web app?” you’re not alone. Modern codebases use so many libraries and frameworks that sometimes it’s hard to keep track of what’s sneaking into your global scope. Variables added at runtime—whether from your own code or third-party scripts—can lead to subtle bugs or naming conflicts down the road.</p><p><strong>That’s where <code>diff-browser-globals</code> comes in.</strong> This small, handy tool helps you identify which global variables are present beyond the standard set that browsers typically provide. In other words, it shows you what’s different between your current <code>window</code> and a known “clean” baseline. This can be a lifesaver when trying to debug unexpected behavior or ensure that libraries aren’t polluting the global scope.</p><h3 id="why-would-you-need-this">Why Would You Need This?</h3><p>Imagine you’re tracking down a naming collision or just want to ensure your code is clean before shipping to production. By comparing the current <code>window</code> object with a default environment, <code>diff-browser-globals</code> highlights any new global variables that have popped up. This makes it easy to see if a polyfill, a script tag, or a particular library is quietly inserting things you didn’t anticipate.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h3><p>The concept is simple: it takes a known list of default globals and compares that to what’s currently on <code>window</code>. Anything not on the default list shows up in the diff. You get a quick, no-nonsense snapshot of what’s new.</p><p>Project link => <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/diff-browser-globals" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/shapkarin/diff-browser-globals<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a></p><p>Once installed, you can run it to see what’s been added to the global scope.

If you have ideas for improvements, additional checks, or better ways to handle certain environments, feel free to contribute. Your pull requests or issues can help make <code>diff-browser-globals</code> even more useful to developers who want to keep their global scopes under control.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="Footer">The API for this site <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/master/src/Generate-Backend" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">is generated<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>and stored as <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/gh-pages/api" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JSON and Markdown<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>on GitHub Pages.<br>It <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">uses Github Actions<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>to help with CI and generates a static version.</footer></div><canvas height="850" id="background" width="480"></canvas></body></html>
