does [] + {} return '[object Object]' in JavaScript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"When using the + operator with objects, JavaScript converts them to primitives. An empty array [] converts to an empty string '', while an empty object {} converts to '[object Object]' via its toString() method. The result is '' + '[object Object]' = '[object Object]'."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why does ['1', '7', '11'].map(parseInt) return [1, NaN, 3]?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The map() method passes both the element and index to the callback function. So parseInt receives: parseInt('1', 0) → 1, parseInt('7', 1) → NaN (base 1 is invalid), parseInt('11', 2) → 3 (binary 11 = 3 in decimal). The fix is to use map(x => parseInt(x, 10)) or map(Number)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is 0.1 + 0.2 not equal to 0.3 in JavaScript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"JavaScript uses IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers. Many decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary, so 0.1 and 0.2 are stored as approximations. When added, the result is 0.30000000000000004 due to accumulated rounding errors. Use epsilon comparisons or decimal libraries for exact arithmetic."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why does typeof null return 'object' in JavaScript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is a well-known bug in JavaScript that dates back to the language's creation. In the original implementation, values were represented by a type tag and value, where objects had a type tag of 0. null was represented as all zeros, so it was incorrectly identified as an object. This behavior is preserved for backward compatibility."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why does NaN === NaN return false?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This is defined by the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. NaN (Not a Number) represents an undefined or unrepresentable value, and by definition, no two undefined values should be considered equal. Use Number.isNaN() or isNaN() to check if a value is NaN."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What's the difference between == and === in JavaScript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The == operator performs loose equality with type coercion, automatically converting operands to comparable types before comparison. The === operator performs strict equality without type coercion, comparing both value and type. For reliable comparisons, prefer === to avoid unexpected type conversion behavior."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why does [] == ![] return true in JavaScript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"First, ![] evaluates to false (arrays are truthy, so negation gives false). Then [] == false becomes a loose equality comparison. The array [] converts to '' (empty string), false converts to 0, and '' converts to 0, so we get 0 == 0 which is true."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I avoid JavaScript type coercion issues?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==), explicitly convert types with Number(), String(), Boolean(), use parseInt() with a radix parameter, enable strict mode ('use strict'), use TypeScript for compile-time type checking, and write unit tests for edge cases."}}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"HowTo","name":"How to Avoid JavaScript Type Coercion Pitfalls","description":"A practical guide to writing defensive JavaScript code that avoids common type coercion issues and unexpected behavior","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shapkarin.me/logo.jpg","width":512,"height":512},"totalTime":"PT30M","supply":[{"@type":"HowToSupply","name":"JavaScript development environment"},{"@type":"HowToSupply","name":"Code editor with linting support"}],"tool":[{"@type":"HowToTool","name":"ESLint or similar JavaScript linter"},{"@type":"HowToTool","name":"TypeScript (optional but recommended)"}],"step":[{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Use strict equality operators","text":"Always use === and !== instead of == and != to avoid automatic type coercion.

JavaScript's dynamic typing, type coercion, loose equality, parsing rules, and handling of edge cases all contribute to these quirks.

Modern specs: if <code>parseInt</code> finds a valid integer portion, it returns that integer. But with <code>".let's"</code> it's ambiguous. Some engines might interpret it differently.

However, these quirks usually follow the language specification consistently:</p><ol><li><strong>Type Coercion</strong>: The <code>+</code> operator can trigger numeric or string operations depending on the operand types.</li><li><strong>Loose Equality</strong>: <code>==</code> tries to align types by a maze of conversions (<code>objects → strings</code>, <code>strings → numbers</code>, booleans → <code>0</code>/<code>1</code>, etc.).</li><li><strong>Floating-Point</strong>: Numbers in JavaScript are IEEE 754 doubles. Precision issues can arise (e.g. <code>0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3</code>).</li><li><strong>Parsing</strong>: <code>parseInt</code>, <code>parseFloat</code> read strings in ways that can truncate or interpret unexpected digits or bases.</li><li><strong>Date and Object to Primitives</strong>: <code>Date</code> objects default to strings, while ordinary objects default to <code>[object Object]</code>, or <code>NaN</code> if forced numerically.</li><li><strong>NaN</strong>: This special numeric value is never equal to anything, including itself.</li></ol><p>Knowing these details helps you understand the surprising results—and avoid bugs in day-to-day coding. When you need reliable results, prefer <strong>strict equality</strong> over <code>==</code>, use explicit type conversions, and treat floating-point with caution. Although these examples can look "weird," they underscore the importance of reading the specification's rules for type conversion and how operators behave with various operand types.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="Footer">The API for this site <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/master/src/Generate-Backend" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">is generated<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>and stored as <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/gh-pages/api" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JSON and Markdown<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>on GitHub Pages.<br>It <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/blob/main/.github/workflows" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">uses Github Actions<svg fill="none" height="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="margin-left:2px"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>to help with CI and generates a static version.</footer></div><canvas height="850" id="background" width="480"></canvas></body></html>
