is the main difference between WAGMI and Ethers.js?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"WAGMI is a React-specific hooks library built on top of Viem and TanStack Query that provides high-level abstractions for web3 development, while Ethers.js is a framework-agnostic, low-level library that gives developers direct control over Ethereum interactions. WAGMI focuses on rapid development with built-in state management, while Ethers.js offers more flexibility and transparency."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I choose WAGMI or Ethers.js for my new web3 project?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Choose WAGMI if you're building a React-based dApp and want rapid development with built-in multichain support, caching, and state management. Choose Ethers.js if you need framework flexibility, prefer low-level control, are building outside React, or want to understand blockchain interactions in detail. Many teams use both - WAGMI for UI components and Ethers.js for complex backend operations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the major breaking changes in WAGMI v2?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"WAGMI v2 introduced several breaking changes: TanStack Query became a peer dependency requiring explicit setup, 'watch' properties and built-in suspense features were removed, connectors changed from classes to functions, MetaMaskConnector was replaced with generic injected connector, 'prepare' hooks like usePrepareContractWrite were replaced with useSimulateContract, and ENS normalization was removed requiring external handling."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use WAGMI with other frameworks besides React?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, WAGMI is specifically designed for React and relies heavily on React hooks and patterns. If you're using Vue, Angular, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript, you should use Ethers.js directly or look for framework-specific alternatives. WAGMI's tight React integration is both its strength for React developers and its limitation for other frameworks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is Viem and how does it relate to WAGMI?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Viem is a TypeScript interface for Ethereum that provides low-level, stateless primitives for blockchain interactions. WAGMI v2 is built on top of Viem instead of Ethers.js, leveraging Viem's performance optimizations and TypeScript-first approach. This change makes WAGMI more lightweight and gives developers access to Viem's advanced features while maintaining the convenience of React hooks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is WAGMI suitable for complex DeFi applications?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, WAGMI is excellent for complex DeFi applications, especially those built with React. Its multichain support, built-in caching with TanStack Query, and hooks for contract interactions make it ideal for DeFi protocols. However, for very advanced scenarios requiring low-level control, you might need to drop down to Viem or combine WAGMI with direct Viem usage for specific operations."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does WAGMI handle wallet connections compared to Ethers.js?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"WAGMI provides built-in wallet connection management with hooks like useConnect and useAccount that handle multiple wallet types automatically. It supports connector-based architecture for different wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) with automatic switching and account management. Ethers.js requires manual implementation of wallet connections, giving more control but requiring more setup code."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the performance implications of using WAGMI vs Ethers.js?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"WAGMI can offer better performance for React applications due to its integration with TanStack Query for intelligent caching and request deduplication. It reduces unnecessary blockchain calls through automatic caching. However, WAGMI has more overhead due to its abstractions. Ethers.js gives you direct control over caching and optimization but requires manual implementation. For simple applications, the performance difference is minimal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I migrate from WAGMI v1 to v2 easily?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Migration from WAGMI v1 to v2 requires significant code changes due to breaking changes. You'll need to install TanStack Query as a peer dependency, update connector configurations, replace 'prepare' hooks with new simulation patterns, handle ENS normalization manually, and update chain configurations. WAGMI provides migration guides, but plan for substantial refactoring time."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Ethers.js still actively maintained and relevant in 2025?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Ethers.js remains actively maintained and highly relevant. It's a mature, battle-tested library used by countless production applications. While newer libraries like Viem offer modern alternatives, Ethers.js continues to be updated and is still the go-to choice for many developers who need framework-agnostic blockchain interactions or prefer its stable, well-documented API."}}]},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"HowTo","name":"How to Choose Between WAGMI and Ethers.js for Ethereum Development","description":"Step-by-step guide to selecting the right Ethereum development library for your web3 project","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shapkarin.me/logo.jpg","width":512,"height":512},"totalTime":"PT20M","estimatedCost":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"USD","value":"0"},"supply":[{"@type":"HowToSupply","name":"Web3 project requirements"},{"@type":"HowToSupply","name":"Team skill assessment"},{"@type":"HowToSupply","name":"Framework preferences"}],"tool":[{"@type":"HowToTool","name":"Project planning documentation"},{"@type":"HowToTool","name":"Technical requirements analysis"}],"step":[{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Evaluate your frontend framework","text":"If you're using React, WAGMI is a strong candidate.

integrate Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains into your web application, two libraries frequently stand out: <strong>WAGMI</strong> and <strong>Ethers.js</strong>. Both have earned strong reputations in the web3 ecosystem, but they fill different niches and suit different developer needs. Understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and how recent changes affect your workflow can help you pick the right library—or combination of libraries—for your project.</p><h3 id="ethers-js-a-dependable-workhorse">Ethers.js: A Dependable Workhorse</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Mature and Stable:</strong> Ethers.js is a long-established, battle-tested library for interacting with Ethereum. It’s used across countless production environments and is known for its reliability and well-documented APIs.</li><li><strong>Framework-Agnostic:</strong> Ethers.js is not tied to any particular frontend framework. Whether you’re building with React, Vue, or just vanilla JavaScript, you can easily integrate it into your stack. This flexibility also extends to backend and CLI environments, making it a versatile all-rounder.</li><li><strong>Full Control and Transparency:</strong> With Ethers.js, you interact directly with providers, signers, contracts, and utilities. You get to decide how to manage state, handle async flows, and structure your code. This is great for developers who want low-level control and are comfortable wiring up their own application logic.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>More Manual Wiring:</strong> Since Ethers.js doesn’t make assumptions about your environment, you’ll spend more time setting up providers, managing wallet connections, and handling queries or mutations manually. This can mean more boilerplate, especially for frontend-heavy dApps.</li><li><strong>Less Guidance Out of the Box:</strong> Ethers.js offers many utilities but leaves architectural decisions to you. If you’re new to web3 or want a ready-made solution, you might find it a bit bare-bones. You need to know what you’re doing—or be prepared to learn.</li></ul><h3 id="wagmi-rapid-dapp-integration-with-a-modern-stack">WAGMI: Rapid dApp Integration with a Modern Stack</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ecosystem Integrations for Speed:</strong> WAGMI originally built on top of Ethers.js, but its latest versions (notably v2) have pivoted to lean heavily on <a href="https://viem.sh/" target="_blank">Viem</a> and <a href="https://tanstack.com/query" target="_blank">TanStack Query</a>. This combination provides powerful caching, state management, and querying capabilities. The result is a streamlined developer experience where you get React hooks that handle common tasks like fetching data, managing accounts, and sending transactions with minimal boilerplate.</li><li><strong>Multichain Support and Account Management:</strong> WAGMI embraces multichain scenarios out of the box. It makes connecting different chains, switching networks, and handling multiple accounts straightforward. For developers working in React, it’s a huge productivity boost.</li><li><strong>Quicker Prototyping:</strong> If you’re building a React-based dApp and need to move fast, WAGMI’s abstractions can save you a ton of time. Hooks like <code>useAccount</code>, <code>useBalance</code>, or <code>useWriteContract</code> let you focus on product features rather than the minutiae of blockchain RPC calls.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Coupled to React and Certain Patterns:</strong> WAGMI is tightly integrated with React. If you’re using another framework or want something more global and framework-independent, this coupling may feel restrictive.</li><li><strong>Less Low-Level Transparency:</strong> While WAGMI provides great convenience, it may hide some complexities. When you hit advanced scenarios or tricky edge cases, you may need to peel back its abstractions and work directly with lower-level libraries like Viem.</li><li><strong>Upgrade and API Changes Can Be Significant:</strong> Because WAGMI sits at a higher abstraction level and integrates closely with multiple libraries, major version changes can bring more extensive modifications to the API and recommended usage patterns.</li></ul><h3 id="insights-on-wagmi-v2-breaking-changes">Insights on WAGMI v2 Breaking Changes</h3><p>WAGMI’s v2 release introduced a series of breaking changes to improve long-term stability and make it a more lightweight wrapper over peer dependencies like Viem and TanStack Query. Some key changes and their implications include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Peer Dependencies:</strong><br>TanStack Query moved to a peer dependency, giving you more control over caching and async state management. This ensures that WAGMI aligns more seamlessly with how many developers already use TanStack Query, but it means you’ll need to set it up in your project’s root configuration explicitly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dropping Internal Abstractions:</strong><br>A number of “watch” properties, built-in suspense features, and prepared transaction hooks were removed. Instead, WAGMI v2 encourages composing functionality from foundational pieces. For example, rather than relying on <code>watch</code> properties or specialized hooks, you’ll integrate <code>useBlock</code>, <code>useBlockNumber</code>, or <code>useQueryClient</code> from TanStack Query directly. This approach gives you finer control and makes the system more predictable, but at the cost of some convenience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reworked Connectors and Chain Handling:</strong><br>The concept of connectors has been revamped. Connectors are now defined by functions rather than classes, and they’re organized through a unified entry point (<code>'wagmi/connectors'</code>). The <code>MetaMaskConnector</code> has been dropped in favor of a more generic <code>injected</code> connector that can target MetaMask specifically. Similarly, chain definitions moved to Viem’s <code>viem/chains</code> repository, streamlining chain management and reflecting a preference for established standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Migration from “prepare” Hooks:</strong><br>The old <code>usePrepareContractWrite</code> and <code>usePrepareSendTransaction</code> hooks have been replaced by new patterns like <code>useSimulateContract</code> and <code>useEstimateGas</code>. Though this might initially seem like more work, it mirrors how you’d reason about the underlying operations at a protocol level—first simulate the contract call or estimate gas, then execute the write. It encourages a clearer mental model of what’s happening under the hood.</p></li><li><p><strong>ENS Name Normalization and Formatting Control:</strong><br>WAGMI v2 stops handling ENS normalization and certain formatting (like token units) internally. This puts the choice back in your hands, letting you decide on normalization strategies or number formatting libraries like <code>dnum</code>. It reduces bundle size and complexity inside WAGMI, but you now must handle formatting explicitly. On the upside, this gives you more power to implement custom logic, localization, or precision handling as needed.</p></li></ul><p>In essence, WAGMI v2 aims to be a stable core on top of Viem and TanStack Query, with fewer hidden complexities. The team has also indicated that future major releases won’t be as disruptive. This aligns with the idea that WAGMI should serve as a thin, composable layer rather than a heavy framework imposing its own logic.</p><h3 id="choosing-between-wagmi-and-ethers-js">Choosing Between WAGMI and Ethers.js</h3><ul><li><p><strong>If You Prefer More Control:</strong><br>Ethers.js is your friend. It’s stable, well-documented, and doesn’t force any architectural decisions. You define your providers, your queries, and your caching strategy. It’s a toolkit for developers who know what they’re doing or who want to learn by building things from scratch.</p></li><li><p><strong>If You Value Convenience and Speed (and Use React):</strong><br>WAGMI, especially in its v2 form, provides a structured approach. You opt into their patterns—multichain support, account management, integrated queries—so you can start shipping features faster. Just be prepared to follow their upgrade paths and integrate with peer dependencies like TanStack Query and Viem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long-Term Evolution:</strong><br>With WAGMI v2’s promise to avoid large-scale breaking changes going forward, it’s settling into a more stable ecosystem role, acting as a helpful glue between various libraries. Ethers.js remains a reliable choice, but as the ecosystem evolves, you might find WAGMI’s curated approach more appealing if your app is UI-heavy and you appreciate having standard patterns readily available.</p></li></ul><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In practice, many teams mix and match these libraries. They might rely on WAGMI for easy-to-use hooks and rapid prototyping, while still dropping down to Ethers.js (or directly to Viem) when they need fine-grained control or when they’re working outside of React’s context. The decision ultimately hinges on your project’s complexity, your team’s preferred coding style, and how comfortable you are adapting to evolving abstractions and APIs.</p><p>Either way, the Ethereum tooling ecosystem is rich, and both WAGMI and Ethers.js are strong contenders. Understanding their differences—and the implications of version changes like WAGMI’s shift in v2—will help you build dApps that are both maintainable and future-proof.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="Footer">The API for this site <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/master/src/Generate-Backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">is generated</a><svg fill="none" height="1em" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg> and stored as <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/tree/gh-@/Pages/api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JSON and Markdown</a><svg fill="none" height="1em" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg> on GitHub Pages.<br>It <a href="https://github.com/shapkarin/shapkarin.me/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">uses Github Actions<svg fill="none" height="1em" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" x2="21" y1="14" y2="3"></line></svg></a>to help with CI and generates a static version.</footer></div><canvas height="850" id="background" width="480"></canvas></body></html>
