It works with a master process that forks multiple worker processes, typically one per CPU core. The master process manages workers and distributes incoming connections among them, while workers handle the actual request processing. This architecture enables true multi-process parallelism for I/O-bound workloads."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The cluster module creates separate processes for scaling I/O-bound workloads, while worker_threads creates threads within the same process for CPU-intensive tasks. Cluster workers have their own memory space and event loop, making them ideal for web servers handling many concurrent connections. Worker threads share memory with the parent process and are designed for offloading CPU-heavy computations without blocking the main event loop. Use cluster for scaling applications, use worker_threads for parallelizing computations."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The cluster module is foundational technology that PM2 actually uses under the hood for its cluster mode. For simple multi-core utilization on a single machine, cluster module is often sufficient and has zero external dependencies. PM2 adds process management features like monitoring, logging, and auto-restart. Docker and Kubernetes are for containerization and orchestration across multiple machines. Understanding cluster helps you make informed decisions about when higher-level tools are necessary versus when native clustering suffices."

          "text": "Typically create one worker process per CPU core using `os.availableParallelism()` (Node.js 19+) or `os.cpus().length`. This maximizes CPU utilization without over-subscription. However, you might adjust based on your workload: for I/O-heavy applications, you could use slightly more workers than cores; for memory-intensive applications, use fewer workers to avoid memory pressure. Monitor your application's performance and resource usage to find the optimal number for your specific use case."

This provides automatic fault tolerance and zero-downtime resilience. You should also implement proper logging to track worker crashes, consider rate-limiting restart attempts to prevent rapid restart loops, and investigate the root cause of crashes. The remaining workers continue serving requests while crashed workers are replaced."

This enables coordination, configuration updates, and custom load balancing logic. Data is serialized when passed between processes, so avoid sending large objects frequently. IPC is useful for broadcasting configuration changes, collecting statistics from workers, implementing custom health checks, or coordinating graceful shutdowns across all processes."

          "text": "The cluster module can provide significant performance improvements: full CPU utilization across all cores (potentially 4-16x improvement on multi-core systems), higher throughput for I/O-bound applications, better responsiveness under load, and improved fault tolerance. Real-world benefits depend on your workload: CPU-bound tasks see less benefit (use worker_threads instead), while I/O-heavy applications like web servers can see dramatic improvements. The exact performance gain scales with the number of CPU cores available."

          "text": "Implement graceful shutdown by listening for SIGTERM/SIGINT signals in the master process, then calling `worker.disconnect()` on all workers. Workers should listen for the 'disconnect' event and stop accepting new connections while finishing existing requests. Use a timeout to force-kill workers that don't shut down within a reasonable time. This ensures in-flight requests complete properly, database connections are closed cleanly, and no user requests are abruptly terminated during deployment or restart."

It's ideal when you want zero-dependency scaling and understand your Node.js runtime. Use worker_threads for CPU-intensive tasks within requests. Use PM2 when you need advanced process management features. Use Docker/Kubernetes for multi-machine orchestration, complex deployment scenarios, or when you need container isolation.
