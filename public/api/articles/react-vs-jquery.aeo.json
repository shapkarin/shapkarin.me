          "text": "Yes, you can use React and jQuery together, but it is generally not recommended. Mixing their different approaches to DOM manipulation can lead to unpredictable bugs and maintenance issues. It should only be considered as a temporary solution during a gradual migration from jQuery to React."

          "text": "For complex and dynamic user interfaces, React is significantly faster than jQuery. React's Virtual DOM minimizes direct DOM operations by batching updates, resulting in performance gains of 2-4x for update-heavy tasks. jQuery's direct DOM manipulation can be inefficient at scale."

Learning it provides more career opportunities and teaches modern development paradigms. jQuery should only be learned if you specifically need to maintain older, legacy codebases."
