      "category": "basics"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Ethereum different from Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "Bitcoin is like a calculator for money transfers, while Ethereum is like a full computer. Bitcoin handles simple transactions, but Ethereum can run any program through smart contracts and supports complex applications like DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.",
      "category": "comparison"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are smart contracts?",
      "answer": "Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms written in code. They work like vending machines - you input what's required, and if conditions are met, you automatically get what was promised without needing intermediaries.",
      "category": "technology"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Ethereum gas?",
      "answer": "Gas is payment for computational work on Ethereum. It's like paying for gasoline to drive your car - more complex operations cost more gas. This prevents spam and ensures network security.",
      "category": "technology"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Ethereum better than Bitcoin?",
      "answer": "They serve different purposes. Bitcoin is digital gold (store of value), while Ethereum is a platform for building applications. Both have value in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How much does it cost to use Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Costs vary based on network congestion. Gas fees can range from $1 to $100+ during peak times. Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum offer much lower costs.",
      "category": "practical"
    },
    {
      "question": "What can you build on Ethereum?",
      "answer": "You can build decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFT marketplaces, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), games, social networks, and any application that benefits from decentralization.",
      "category": "applications"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Ethereum secure?",
      "answer": "The Ethereum network itself is very secure, protected by thousands of validators. However, individual smart contracts can have bugs, so always use audited and well-tested applications.",
      "category": "security"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who created Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin, who wrote the original whitepaper in 2014 when he was just 19 years old. The platform launched in 2015 with help from other co-founders.",
      "category": "history"
    },
    {
      "question": "What programming languages work with Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Solidity is the most popular language for smart contracts, but you can also use Vyper. You can interact with Ethereum using JavaScript, Python, and other languages through libraries.",
