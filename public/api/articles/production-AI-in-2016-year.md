The first time I worked on a project using machine learning (AI) was in 2016. Back then, the technology hadn't seen the mass adoption it has now, thanks to LLMs. It was Bioinformatics project, and a one FinTech.

The training data had to be extremely clean. In some implementations, this is still true for most of the model training process (work of data engineers and etc)

Back then, we had ways to input unorganized text, images (and more) data (not for training), but it wasn't like today's chat interfaces where you can attach or even search (crawl) any kind of unstructured data and get high-quality results: well-structured (in various formats, tailored to the user) and easy for everyone to understand.

It's ironic that, despite those projects yielding solid results, almost no one took the AI approach seriously, even in niche applications. Now, the tech is used everywhere, sometimes even where it's not really needed â€” just because of user-friendly chat interfaces and cheaper computation. Back then, it was the realm of futurists and dreamers; now, it's serious business. In my view, the key driver of real progress wasn't just optimization or lower computing costs but the convenience that brought AI to the masses. LLMs changed the game.
