It continuously monitors the call stack and task queues, executing synchronous code first, then processing all microtasks (like Promise callbacks), and finally handling macrotasks (like setTimeout callbacks) one at a time. This creates the illusion of concurrency while maintaining single-threaded execution."

After each macrotask execution, the event loop processes ALL available microtasks before moving to the next macrotask. This means Promise callbacks always execute before setTimeout callbacks, even if the setTimeout delay is 0. Microtasks include Promise reactions, queueMicrotask(), and MutationObserver callbacks."

Regular async JavaScript (promises, async/await) is perfect for I/O operations like network requests, file reading, or timers.

          "text": "No, Web Workers cannot directly access the DOM, window object, or parent object. This is by design to prevent race conditions and thread safety issues. Workers must communicate with the main thread via postMessage() to update the UI. Workers can use XMLHttpRequest, fetch(), timers, and other non-UI browser APIs. This isolation ensures thread safety but requires careful planning for data communication."

Data is copied by default (structured cloning), which can be slow for large objects. For better performance with large data, use Transferable Objects like ArrayBuffer which transfer ownership instead of copying. Always handle errors with onerror event handlers and remember that all communication is asynchronous."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "setTimeout(callback, 0) doesn't execute immediately because it places the callback in the macrotask queue, which is processed only after the current execution stack is empty and all microtasks are completed. Even with 0 delay, it must wait for the event loop to finish current synchronous code and process any pending Promise callbacks (microtasks). This is why console.log() statements after setTimeout will often execute first."

          "text": "Web Workers have creation overhead and data transfer costs through message passing. Creating a worker takes time, and copying large objects between threads can be expensive. However, for CPU-intensive tasks, Workers prevent main thread blocking and provide true parallelism, often resulting in better overall performance and user experience. Use Workers for tasks longer than ~50ms that would otherwise freeze the UI."

          "text": "Callbacks are functions passed as arguments and executed later, but can lead to 'callback hell' with nested operations. Promises provide better error handling and chaining with .then() and .catch(), avoiding deep nesting. Async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to read/debug. All three patterns work with the same event loop mechanism but offer different developer experiences."

While JavaScript execution is single-threaded, the browser/Node.js environment provides Web APIs (timers, network, file I/O) that run on separate threads. When these operations complete, their callbacks are queued for execution. The event loop coordinates this by processing one task at a time while maintaining responsiveness."
