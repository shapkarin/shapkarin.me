    "question": "What is Ethereum ABI (Application Binary Interface)?",
    "answer": "The Ethereum ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a standardized way to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. Think of ABI as a bridge between your application and smart contracts - it defines how to encode function calls and decode responses. ABI is like a contract's instruction manual that tells applications exactly how to communicate with smart contracts.",
    "type": "definition"
  },
  "key_concepts": [
    {
      "term": "ABI (Application Binary Interface)",
      "definition": "A standardized specification that defines how to interact with smart contracts, including function signatures, parameter types, and return values",
      "importance": "Essential for any dApp development and smart contract interaction"
    },
    {
      "term": "Function Selector",
      "definition": "A 4-byte identifier derived from a function's signature hash, used to identify which contract function to call",
      "importance": "Enables function routing and collision detection in smart contracts"
    },
    {
      "term": "ABI Encoding",
      "definition": "The process of converting function parameters into bytecode that the EVM can understand and execute",
      "importance": "Fundamental to all smart contract interactions and data transmission"
    },
    {
      "term": "Event Encoding",

    }
  ],
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between ABI and bytecode?",
      "answer": "ABI is the interface specification (like a menu) that tells you what functions exist and how to call them, while bytecode is the actual contract code (like the kitchen) that executes on the blockchain. ABI provides the structure for interaction, bytecode provides the implementation.",
      "category": "basics"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I interact with a smart contract without its ABI?",
      "answer": "Technically yes, but it's very difficult and not recommended. You'd need to manually encode function calls and decode responses. Some tools can reverse-engineer ABIs from bytecode, but having the original ABI is always preferable for reliability and ease of development.",
      "category": "basics"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I generate an ABI from my smart contract?",
      "answer": "Use development frameworks like Hardhat (`npx hardhat compile`), Foundry (`forge build`), Truffle (`truffle compile`), or Brownie (`brownie compile`). These tools automatically generate ABI files from your Solidity source code during compilation.",
      "category": "development"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are ABIs the same across all EVM chains?",
      "answer": "Yes! ABI is an EVM standard, so the same ABI works on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, and all other EVM-compatible chains. This makes it easy to deploy dApps across multiple networks.",
      "category": "multichain"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I use the wrong ABI?",
      "answer": "You'll encounter encoding/decoding errors, failed transactions, or incorrect data interpretation. Always verify that your ABI matches the deployed contract version to avoid these issues.",
      "category": "troubleshooting"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do function selectors work in Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Function selectors are 4-byte identifiers created by taking the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature. Example: `transfer(address,uint256)` becomes `0xa9059cbb`. This selector routes function calls to the correct contract method.",
      "category": "technical"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are indexed parameters in events?",
      "answer": "Indexed parameters in events are stored in the log's topics array and are searchable/filterable. You can have up to 3 indexed parameters per event. Non-indexed parameters are stored in the log's data field and are cheaper but not searchable.",
      "category": "events"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I debug ABI-related issues?",
      "answer": "Verify function signatures match exactly, check parameter types and order, validate addresses and network, use ABI debugging tools, and test with known working examples. Common issues include mismatched function names, incorrect parameter types, and outdated ABIs.",
      "category": "troubleshooting"
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between view and pure functions?",
      "answer": "View functions can read blockchain state but not modify it, while pure functions cannot read or modify state at all. View functions cost gas when called externally, pure functions are completely free to call since they don't access any blockchain data.",
      "category": "technical"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I optimize ABI for production use?",
      "answer": "Tree-shake to include only needed functions, minimize by removing unnecessary metadata, cache ABIs locally, use CDN for ABI distribution, and version your ABI files. This reduces bundle size and improves performance.",
