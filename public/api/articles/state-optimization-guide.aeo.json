It's critical because poor state management can cause 10-100x performance degradation in data-heavy applications, leading to slow renders, poor user experience, and increased memory usage. Proper optimization can dramatically improve app responsiveness and user satisfaction."

Object operations are O(1) complexity while array operations are O(n). For 10,000 items, object-based lookups are 100-1000x faster than array searches. Use objects with ID-based keys for entity storage and only use arrays for ordered lists or when you specifically need array methods."

It's 1.5-1.8x faster than Redux, uses 38% less memory, has 56% smaller bundle impact, and provides excellent TypeScript support with simpler APIs.

Zustand's built-in selector system makes this particularly easy."

          "text": "Normalized state provides dramatic performance improvements: O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches, elimination of data duplication reducing memory usage by 20-30%, easier updates without deep cloning, better cache efficiency, and prevention of update cascades. For applications with 1000+ entities, normalization can provide 10-50x performance improvements in update operations."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Virtual scrolling renders only visible items in large lists, dramatically improving performance. Implement by calculating visible range based on scroll position and item height, rendering only items in the visible range plus a small buffer, maintaining proper list height for scrollbar accuracy, and updating the visible range as the user scrolls. This can handle millions of items with consistent 60fps performance."

For frequent updates, Context causes entire component tree re-renders and can be 8-45x slower than optimized state libraries. Use Zustand or Redux for application state with frequent updates, global state that many components access, or when you need performance optimization features like selective subscriptions."
